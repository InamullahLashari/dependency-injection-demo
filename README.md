This project demonstrates the concept of Dependency Injection (DI) using the Spring Framework in Java. It includes examples of constructor-based, setter-based, and field-based injection and showcases how Spring simplifies the management of dependencies in applications. Ideal for learning the fundamentals of DI and IoC containers.
